# Contributing to POMC

Thanks for your interest in contributing to POMC!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork and set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/POMC.git
   cd POMC
   rustup override set nightly
   ```
3. Extract vanilla 1.21.11 assets into `reference/assets/`:
   ```bash
   unzip ~/.minecraft/versions/1.21.11/1.21.11.jar -d reference/assets/
   ```
4. Build and run:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run -- --server localhost:25565 --username Steve
   ```

## Before Submitting a PR

All of these must pass. CI will reject your PR if they don't.

### Client (Rust)

```bash
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy --release --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build --release
```

### Launcher Backend (Rust)

```bash
cd launcher/src-tauri
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy --release --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

### Launcher Frontend (TypeScript)

```bash
cd launcher
pnpm install
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm exec vite build
```

## Development Guidelines

- **Rust nightly** is required (due to `simdnbt` dependency)
- No unnecessary comments. Code should be self-explanatory
- No DRY violations. Don't duplicate logic, extract shared helpers
- No `unwrap()` outside of tests
- Keep changes focused. One feature or fix per PR
- Use `feat/`, `fix/`, `perf/`, `refactor/`, `chore/` branch prefixes

## Pull Request Format

Every PR must include:

```markdown
## Summary
- Brief bullet points of what changed and why

## Test plan
- [ ] Steps to verify the changes work
- [ ] Edge cases checked
```

For bug fixes, also include:
- What the issue was
- What caused it
- How it was fixed
